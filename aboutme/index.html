    <p>Hey guys, this is Jason. I am so glad I can be here to study and live with you all. I am from China, a city called Shenzhen. It's a beautiful city near Hong Kong.</p >
    <p>About by family, i live with my parents and brother when I was in China.</p>
    <p>I joined the church and got baptized in 2016 in Mexico. It was a wonderful experience, and I am so happy I made the right decision.</p>
